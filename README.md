Diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period.
Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated. diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.

# Details about the dataset

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on

# Objective

We will try to build a machine leaming model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?

# Result

The model created as a result of XGBoost hyperparameter optimization became the model with the lowest Cross Validation Score value, (0.90)
